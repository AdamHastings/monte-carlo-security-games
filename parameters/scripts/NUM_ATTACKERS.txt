There are roughly 50 active ransomware groups in a given year (Table 1)

NUM_ATTACKERS = 50

about 50 groups pulling off ~5000 attacks per year

ATTACKS_PER_EPOCH = 100

https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-by-the-numbers/rise-in-active-raas-groups-parallel-growing-victim-counts-ransomware-in-2h-2023 (Table 1)

Each group is pulling off say 100 attacks per year (epoch)

Chance of getting targeted by a single ransomware actor: ATTACKS_PER_EPOCH / NUM_DEFENDERS
Chance of not getting targeted by a single ransomware actor: 1 - (ATTACKS_PER_EPOCH / NUM_DEFENDERS)

Chance of getting targeted at all in a given epoch = 1 - (ATTACKS_PER_EPOCH/ NUM_DEFENDERS) ^ (NUM_ATTACKERS)

If ATTACKS_PER_EPOCH = 100
NUM_DEFENDERS = 10,000
NUM_ATTACKERS = 50

then Chance of getting targeted at all in a given epoch = (1-100/10,000) ^ 50 = 0.605 which is very close to Sophos's reported 59% for 2024 (p.3)
