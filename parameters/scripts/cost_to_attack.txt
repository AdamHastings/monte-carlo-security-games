Reports $100M in revenue and $31.2 in expenses

Roughly estimate that ransomware actors spend 33% of the ransom on expenses


This is in line with other sources that estimate an ROI of +163% (https://www.riskinsight-wavestone.com/en/2022/07/ransomware-inside-the-former-conti-group/)


e.g. $3M investment yields 3 * (1 + 1.62) = 7.86

3 / 7.86 = 38%
